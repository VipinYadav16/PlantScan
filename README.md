# ðŸŒ¿ **Plant Leaf Disease Detection using Flask and TensorFlow** 

---

## **About the Project**

This is a **Flask-based web application** that uses a **deep learning model** to detect plant leaf diseases.  
The model is trained on a dataset of **38 plant classes**, including both healthy and diseased leaves, and provides the **confidence score** along with the disease name.
